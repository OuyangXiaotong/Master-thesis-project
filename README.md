Title: Tele-medicine application: self-serviced dental cleaning solution based on soft robot and remote control
## Overview
 In the context of the risk of cross-contamination of traditional teeth-washing mode, a remote teeth-cleaning solution based on the robot and teleoperation system is proposed. The challenging situation brought about by traditional teeth cleaning methods is changed through the application of object detection and posture estimation algorithms in the medical field and the innovation in the oral surgery scenario.
